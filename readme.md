# Saphire-typegen

This crate is part of the saphire project, for more info see Saphire-rs.

This crate is split into 2 halfs, one for types to help serialize and deserialize [Diamondfire's](mcdiamondfire.net) actiondump, and the other half provides functions to do code generation from said actiondump. This crate is mostly intended to be used internally for Saphire-types, but if there is something that you would like to be able to do with it feel free to open an issue.
